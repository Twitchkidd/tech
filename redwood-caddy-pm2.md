# Serving a Redwoodjs App On A Linode Server Using Caddy and PM2

Thanks to everyone who built all these tools and the other people figuring out serverful serverless. We're the whole yin-yang.

## Server

Okay, first you need a Linux box, I use Linode, and I assume the reader can get their box set up and secured with the Linode docs and/or the (Feross Aboukhadijeh article.)[https://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode/] Mine's called Marvin, and I ssh in with `marvin` :)

## Finding myself in a rush

I just spend a bunch of time trying to get someother stuff fixed and am going to have to come back to this!

Don't forget to copy the .env file over to source, though! That's the last piece of the puzzle
